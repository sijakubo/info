Hey, I'm Simon, a software developer since 2008 and an enthusiastic coder. 
I love solving problems with clean code, and I mainly work on backend development using **Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, and Python**.

As an **iSAQB®-certified software architect**, I build scalable systems and enjoy experimenting with new technologies.

When I'm not coding, I like exploring new technologies or simply enjoying a good cup of coffee. ☕
